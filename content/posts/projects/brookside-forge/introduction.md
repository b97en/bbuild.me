Welcome to the first official devlog for Brookside Forge! This entry documents the key conceptual milestones and systems we’ve fleshed out in the early design phase of our cozy blacksmith-life sim with folklore-fantasy vibes.

### 🎯 Core Vision

We’ve locked in our high-concept identity:

A top-down pixel-art adventure where you inherit a forge in post-war Yorkshire, blending British and Japanese smithing, self-sufficient homesteading, and soft-fantasy storytelling.

Design Pillars:
Craft & Progression: A blacksmithing system evolving from rudimentary iron tools to mythical Damascus and tamahagane blades.

Homestead & Hustle: Farming, bees, jam, wine, stout — all to fund and feed your forge.

Story & Community: Post-war healing, village revival, and East-West cultural fusion.

### 🔨 Systems Progress

Blacksmithing Progression
Tiered Forging Path: Surface mining → Bloomery → Alloy mastery → Damascus → Japanese mastery

Each tier unlocks new gear, materials (e.g., bronze, tamahagane), and techniques (e.g., pattern-welding, differential quenching)

Signature unlocks: Greataxe, Bronze Serpent Shield, Kensei’s Edge Katana

Homesteading Economy
Progression from simple stews and jam to:

Microbrews (Deepwater Stout)

Damascus jewelry

Herbalism + exotic cuisine

Endgame spirits (Spirit of the Forge whiskey)

NPC hiring (e.g., apprentice smith, fishmonger, festival coordinator)

Revenue scaling with prestige commissions and blueprints

Church & Renown System
Renown ranks (Novice → Patron) influence:

NPC perks (discounts, buffs)

Moral trade-offs (tithes vs. profit)

Late-game social synergy

Integrated sidequests tied to infirmary, relic recovery, and chapel building

### 🗺️ World Design

Village Map Regions (Inspired by Clapham, Yorkshire)
East Side: Brookside Forge, gardens, sawmill, farm

West Side: Stables, market square, inn, forage meadows

North: Edward’s Cave — a deep, multi-biome dungeon progression system

Lower West: School (stat buffs), library (blueprint access)

Central: Church hub for questing and buffs

### 🎮 Gameplay Loop Overview

Gather – Mine, forage, and farm

Craft – Forge weapons/tools, cook, brew, and create goods

Deliver – Fulfill village commissions and side contracts

Upgrade – Invest in forge gear, homestead expansions, and social perks

Explore – Venture into caves, ruins, and mythic zones for rare loot

Repeat – Progress toward mastery and narrative milestones

### 🧪 Technical Direction

Engine: Godot 4

Art: Aseprite (32x32 or 48x48 sprites)

Style: Muted earthy palette with fantasy-tinted shaders

Soundtrack: Lo-fi folk/chiptune fusion with ambient SFX

Build Pipeline: GitHub Actions for CI/CD + nightly builds

### 🔮 What’s Next

Prototyping the forge minigame and core crafting loop

Implementing the first tilemap and homestead interactions

Establishing a vertical slice (Week 4 target)
